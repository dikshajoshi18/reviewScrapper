1. Web Scraping(Text)
   Web scraping is a technique using which the webpages from the internet are fetched and parsed to understand and extract specific information similar to a human being. Web scrapping consists of two parts:
   • Web Crawling→ Accessing the webpages over the internet and pulling data from them.
   • HTML Parsing→ Parsing the HTML content of the webpages obtained through web crawling and then extracting specific information from it.
   Hence, web scrappers are applications/bots, which automatically send requests to websites and then extract the desired information from the website output.
